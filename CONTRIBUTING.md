5. Check the feature in your browser
6. Commit changes
7. Push branch
8. Create a Pull Request

Additionally, when creating a pull request, please keep the following in mind:

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

## How to set up a local development environment

First, clone the forked repository locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/snachodog/tok-to-insta-follower-bridge.git
```

Install dependencies with npm:

```bash
$ npm i
```

The dev command starts the development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

When the development server starts, the extension build results are output to the `extension` directory.

You can use the built extension in your browser by loading the contents of the extensions folder in Chrome:

When you modify the code, the change is automatically reflected.
